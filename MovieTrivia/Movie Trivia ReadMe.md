# Project Title

Welcome to the Movie Trivia game! This is my first stab at building something from scratch using my new-found software skills.

I decided to do something lighthearted and fun, and in line with my personal interest. I've always enjoyed watching movies, and I used to play all these trivia games with my friends growing up. I thought I'd combine both to create a movie trivia game where folks can test out their knowledge of classic movies against their friends!

## Getting Started

This game runs on a web browser, and requires Javascript to be enabled.

### Prerequisites

As long as you have a web browser (who doesn't have one?!), you're all set!

### Technologies Used

I used HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap and jQuery to build this product. These are the skills picked up over the past 8 weeks at my General Assembly Software Engineering course!

## Approach Taken

The approach I took was as follows:
1) Determine overall layout of the site, and set up bootstrap Template as well as link to jQuery library
2) Build different nav bar pages to display rules and set Parameters
3) Build API calls for movies
4) Build carousel for populating movie Posters
5) Build answer panel for players to provide their responses
6) Set up misc functionalities: timer, rounds, 2 player rotation
7) Set up winning logic
8) Test functionality and fix bugs (Preventing duplicate movies, ensuring interactive functionality after player switch occurs, fixing carousel bugs)
9) Refactor code for readability and future enhancements
10) Populate remainder of movie database

### Unsolved Problems

In terms of future development, I plan to work on the following features:
1) Expanding question bank beyond just year of movie
2) Include tracking of carousel index
3) Include option to pick movie based on trivia facts
